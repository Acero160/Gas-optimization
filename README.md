# â›½ Gas Optimization Techniques in Solidity

This repository contains a smart contract showcasing **20 practical gas optimization techniques** for Ethereum smart contract development using Solidity.

Gas optimization is essential for reducing transaction costs and improving the efficiency of smart contracts. This project demonstrates each technique with real Solidity code examples, highlighting both **"what to avoid"** and **"what to do instead"**.

## ðŸš€ Overview

The `GasOptimization` contract includes 20 techniques that cover a wide range of topics, such as:

- Data structures
- Memory management
- Function patterns
- Storage manipulation
- Compiler configurations
- Logical operations
- Calling external contracts

All techniques are annotated with clear, easy-to-understand comments, making this a practical reference for developers who want to write more efficient smart contracts.

## ðŸ“˜ Techniques Included

1. Use mappings instead of arrays  
2. Optimize variable ordering for storage slots  
3. Enable the Solidity optimizer  
4. Assign loop limits to local variables  
5. Perform operations in batches when possible  
6. Use `indexed` in events appropriately  
7. Use `constant` and `immutable` variables  
8. Prefer `uint256` over `uint8` in loops  
9. Delete unused variables  
10. Use the `external` modifier where applicable  
11. Use `unchecked` blocks for safe arithmetic  
12. Replace `require` strings with custom errors  
13. Avoid reusable modifiers for repetitive checks  
14. Use `calldata` instead of `memory`  
15. Group function parameters using `structs`  
16. Use `libraries` where applicable  
17. Avoid direct manipulation of storage  
18. Optimize logical expressions (`&&`, `||`)  
19. Prefer fixed-size arrays  
20. Use function selectors over full function signatures
